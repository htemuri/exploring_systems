# Linux

There are many awesome books on the Linux kernel that go into great depth about the various systems that Linux has setup. This is not meant to act as a textbook on Linux - it is meant to show how Linux works through the proxy of examples.

## Some useful books and links
- [The Linux Programming Interface](https://man7.org/tlpi/)
- [Mirror of Linux kernel source tree](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
